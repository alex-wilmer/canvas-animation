# Remaking 'The Golden Angle'

**[Demo](http://alex-wilmer.github.io/canvas-animation/)** - If you see an empty black screen, move your mouse around.

**[Audio Visualizer Demo](http://45.55.239.144:8000/)** - May take 5 - 10 seconds to load audio.

### A Simple HTML5 Canvas Tutorial

When I first saw [The Golden Angle](http://codepen.io/tucsky/pen/QjmpBw) by [@Tucsky](https://twitter.com/Tucsky) I marveled at the beauty of the animation, but was astonished by what seemed like an impossibly short program. In this repository I have deconstructed the code into a series of simple steps.

Hopefully after this you will feel confident about using the canvas API and be inspired to you create your own animations.

### Setup

This project uses [Minimalist App Starter](https://github.com/alex-wilmer/app-starter) which requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). The code itself is written in ES6 / ES2015 transpiled with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

Assuming Node is installed already:

```
npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server
npm install
npm start
```

This will run the Webpack dev server which will refresh the page for us every time we modify and save our code.

Go to `localhost:8080` in your browser to see the completed animation.
